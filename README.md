instamail
=========

This is a rough prototype of a variant of the famous Mac OS Mail app that removes the need for even sending mails by using some special kind of magic.

It requires a web server to run in this folder, accessible via `http://localhost/instamail/`. Oh and it also requires you to have internet access.

Have fun!
